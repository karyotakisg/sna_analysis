# 🚀 Bluesky Network Explorer 🕵️‍♂️

Welcome to **Bluesky Network Explorer**, a collection of notebooks delving into the fascinating world of social networks. This project fulfills the requirements of the 2024/2025 Social Network Analysis assignment for the Department of Management Science and Technology at the Athens University of Economics and Business.

## 🧰 Tools of the Trade
This project brings together an arsenal of cutting-edge tools and libraries to unravel the mysteries of networks:
- **Python** 🐍: The engine that drives it all. From crunching data to plotting networks, Python has your back!
- **NetworkX**: For all things graph-related, including calculating centrality, finding cliques, and much more.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** 🎨: Beautiful, eye-catching visualizations to turn numbers into stories.
- **Gephi** 🌐: The visualization powerhouse used for crafting layouts and modularity magic.
- **Pandas** 🐼: Because spreadsheets are so last decade.

## 🌟 Features
- **Centrality Superpowers**: Want to know who the movers and shakers are? We've got degree, closeness, betweenness, and even eigenvector centrality covered!
- **Clique-Spotting**: Identify maximal cliques and the mighty *maximum clique*. Yes, even the tiny dyads get their time in the spotlight.
- **Community Detective Work**: Using modularity to find clusters and highlight hidden patterns.
- **Pathfinder Adventures**: Discover how information travels (spoiler: fast and efficiently).
- **Sparse Network Analysis**: Because sometimes, less is more.

## 📊 Visuals Galore
We don’t just crunch the numbers – we make them pop! With dynamic node sizes and colors based on centrality, our graphs practically tell their own stories. And if you like histograms, scatterplots, and log-log power-law plots, you're in for a treat. 🖼️
